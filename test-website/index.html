    <p>This webpage is a practice project dedicated to my dear brothers and our Thorsheim Kindred.</p> 
     <p> Back in 2021 there were only 3 of us: Eduard, Donald and Myself. At the time... we weren't calling ourselves a kindred.</p>
      <p>After much thought and consideration we decided we wanted to formalize our gatherings and bonds of kinship in the form of a kindred.</p>
      <p>A year later we were lucky enough to add another brother, Joe, to the kindred.</p>
      <p>Thorsheim Kindred is a gathering of likeminded folk that enjoy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Honoring The Old Norse Gods</li>
        <li> Honoring The Ancestors</li>
        <li> Learning about the History and Traditions of the Old Norse</li>
      </ul>
